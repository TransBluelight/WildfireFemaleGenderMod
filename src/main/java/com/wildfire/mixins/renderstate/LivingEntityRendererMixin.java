	 * This is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad bodge solution, which ideally we wouldn't need to do to begin with,
	 * but unfortunately with how this mod works, and with the changes made to entity renderers, we do.
	 *
	 * As of 24w33a (1.21.2), Mojang has replaced the entity reference provided to feature renderer instances with an
	 * _incredibly_ simplified render state object; while the player render state does provide a way for us to get
	 * the entity (by means of a provided entity ID), armor stands (and by extension all other entity types) lack
	 * this same entity ID property.
	 *
	 * As such, the only real way to actually get the rendered entity for non-player entities is to capture it in a
	 * variable further up the chain, before the game actually runs any feature renderers.
